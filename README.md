# porosity_prediction_for_CCS_assessment_using_boosting_ensemble_machine-learning_algorithms
This code was developed as a part of a study where feasibility of boosting ensemble machine learning models were investigated in porosity prediction of a carbon capture and storage assessment program. Three regression friendly boosting algorithms were developed, namely, adaptive boosting regression (AdaBR), gradient boosting regression (GBR), extreme gradient boosting regressiong (XGBR). The three codes are povided for each model developed for each model AdaBR (AdaBR_Code), GBR (GBR_COde) and XGBR (XGBR_Code).
